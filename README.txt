**** README ****

To run the application the following dependencies must be installed:

MySQL Server
MySQL Workbench
JDK 15
JavaFX SDK
IntelliJ IDE

Source Code is found within the 'project-planning' folder.

The first step is to set up the database in MySQL. To do this, open the MySQL Workbench and connect to your MySQL server. Create a new schema called 'project_manager' and run the 'Database20201011.sql' file in order to create the appropriate tables and data for the project manager application to function.


Once the above have been installed and configured, open the 'FinalProject' folder as a project in IntelliJ and choose 'Run' under the 'Run' menu. With the dependencies set up correctly, the application with then compile and you will see the application appear.
